# 🧭 React + Vite Starter Template Documentation

Welcome to the documentation site for the **React + Vite Starter Template**! This project is designed to help you (and your future self) start new front-end projects quickly with a solid, modern setup and a clean development experience.

---

## 📘 Overview

This template provides:

- ⚛️ React + Vite + TypeScript
- 🎨 ESLint, Prettier, and Stylelint
- ✅ Vitest for unit testing
- 🔐 Husky, Commitlint, Commitizen, and Lint-Staged for Git workflow automation
- 📁 Clean and modular project structure
- 🛠 Configurable environment with EditorConfig and VS Code support

This boilerplate is designed for:

- SPAs, dashboards, component libraries, design systems
- Developers who prefer configuring their own tools (rather than using CRA or Next.js out-of-the-box)
- Quick setup with opinionated defaults and best practices
